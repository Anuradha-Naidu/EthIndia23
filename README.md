# Video DAO

Video DAO is a decentralized video creation platform that operates on the principles of decentralization and utilizes smart contracts deployed on various EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions like Polygon, Mantle, and Arbitrum. The platform allows users to create, sell, reward, and advertise videos while contributing to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by the VID token.

## Overview

### Key Features

- **NFT Videos:** Every video created on Video DAO is minted as a non-fungible token (NFT) stored on IPFS, ensuring ownership and uniqueness.
- **Monetization:** Creators can monetize their videos by selling them on the platform's marketplace or accepting advertisements, earning a portion of the revenue while contributing 1% to the DAO vault.
- **Rewards and Contributions:** Users can reward videos they appreciate, with a portion of the reward directed to the video owner and 1% to the DAO vault, rewarding contributors.
- **DAO Governance:** VID token holders can create proposals, vote on funding allocations, and participate in platform governance. Proposals are stored on IPFS for transparency and accessibility.

### Contracts

- **UserCenter:** Allows user registration, tracks credits, and facilitates conversion from credits to VID tokens.
- **Creation:** Enables video creation, stores video information on IPFS, and manages reward distributions.
- **Market:** Provides a platform for listing, selling videos, and accepting advertisements, with a portion of earnings directed to the DAO vault.

### Tokenomics
